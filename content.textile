*Dear Senator,*

Great day! I'm writing to you about the recent issues about the _online libel_ provision of of the cybercrime law.

Senator, I fear for the future of our country. I think the _online libel_ provision can jeopardize our democracy. I want to live in a country where the citizens are free to praise the politicians, or point out their flaws, without fear of their words being taken against them.

Please, I urge you to support abolishing this provision from the law, for the sake of citizens like me and for our nation.

Yours truly,
_Rico Sta. Cruz_
