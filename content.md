### Find the contact number.

The list below has the numbers for the senator's official and non-official
offices. Try to call the direct line first before trying the trunk lines.

### Introduce yourself.

> "Hello! Ako po si Rico Sta. Cruz ng Makati. Tumatawag po ako tungkol sa isyu
  ng _online libel at ang cybercrime bill_. Gusto ko po'ng malaman ang
  posisyon ni senador ukol dito, at magpahayag ng aking hikain."

> "Hello! I'm Rico Sta. Cruz of Makati. I'm calling about the issue of _online
  libel and the cybercrime bill_. I'd like to learn about the senator's
  position on this issue, and perhaps tell you about my stance on it for your
  consideration."

A member of the senator's staff is going to answer your call. Be polite and
don't be shy! They take these kind of calls often. Feel free to speak in either
English or Tagalog.

Ask who you can speak to about asking about the issue ond your concerns.

### Understand the issue.

> "Ano po ang posisyon ni senador tungkol dito? Sya po ba ay su-su-porta sa
pag-apila ng batas na ito?"

> "How does the senator feel about this issue? Will he/she be supporting the
amendment of this law?"

Ask about the senator's stance on the issue. It may be different from what you
already know about.

### Speak your mind.

> "Sa tingin ko ay ang _online libel_ provision ng cybercrime bill ay
  makaka-sira ng demokrasya ng ating lipunan. Bilang isang botante, ako po ay
  natatakot para sa kinabukasan ng ating bayan. Gusto ko po sanang mahingi ang
  suporta ni senador sa pag apila ng batas na ito, para sa mga mamayanang tulad
  ko at para sa ating bayan."

> "I think the _online libel_ provision on the cybercrime law jeopardizes the
  democracy of the country as a whole. As a voter, I fear for the future of
  our country. I urge the senator to support abolishing this provision from the
  law, for the sake of citizens like me and for our nation."

Ask for the support of the senator to support your cause. Present your arguments
rationally. Refrain from making personal attacks; instead, be rational and
stress why this issue is important to you.

### Follow up later.

If you call, send an email a few days later as well just to be sure that your
call isn't forgotten.
